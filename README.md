## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- /library: The source code for the optimization library built throughout the semester. This includes:
   - /algorithms: Functions and classes that implement a variety of optimization algorithms
   - /problems: Classes that define and implement various optimization problems and provide a way to solve them using the algorithms developed

- /data: The problem data (guest relationship chart)
   - seating_data.csv: source data file
   - relationship_matrix.py: converting the .csv to a numpy array for easy import
- /project: Developed work
   - workshop.ipynb: notebook experimenting and developing required functions and classes for the genetic algorithm
